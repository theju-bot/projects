      <p class="q">What is JavaScript?</p>
      <p class="a none">
        JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.
      </p>
      <p class="q">What is the difference between var, let, and const?</p>
      <p class="a none">
        var is function-scoped, let and const are block-scoped; const can't be
        reassigned.
      </p>
      <p class="q">What is DOM in JavaScript?</p>
      <p class="a none">
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is a structured representation of the
        HTML that JavaScript can manipulate.
      </p>
      <p class="q">What is an event listener?</p>
      <p class="a none">
        An event listener waits for user actions (like clicks or keypresses) and
        runs code in response.
      </p>
      <p class="q">What is the difference between == and ===?</p>
      <p class="a none">== checks value only, === checks value and type.</p>
